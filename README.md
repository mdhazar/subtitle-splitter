**Purpose:**
The purpose of this code is to segment machine-translated subtitles based on pre-defined timecodes. 
It achieves this by dividing the machine-translated subtitles according to pre-defined time intervals.
By doing so, the code ensures that the translated segments are synchronized with specific moments in the video or audio content.

**Functionality:**
- **Reading the Subtitle File:** 
  The code opens and reads the given subtitle file.

- **Segmentation Based on Timecodes:** 
  By dividing the text in the subtitle file according to timecodes, it identifies translation segments.

- **Creating a New Subtitle File:** 
  It creates a new subtitle file containing the segmented translation segments based on the defined timecodes.

- **Checking and Adjusting Timeframe Durations:**
  - The script checks the duration of the first timestamp interval.
  - If the duration is less than 1 second, it removes the entire first timestamp interval.
  - This step ensures that the timestamp intervals meet specific duration requirements, such as a minimum duration.

- **Dividing Text Content Within Timeframes:**
  - The script divides the text content within each timestamp interval into smaller segments.
  - It calculates the optimal segmentation based on the length of the text and the number of timestamp intervals.
  - Each segment aims to balance readability and synchronization with the corresponding multimedia content.
